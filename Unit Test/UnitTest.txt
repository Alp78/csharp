Unit Testing

Unit Test = function that test a unit of work

several unit testing frameworks available for .NET

- MSTest / Nunit / MbUnit / xUnit.net

--> MSTest integrated with VS

1) Add a Unit Test project to the solution
2) Decorate the class that contains test methods with TestClass attrtibute
3) Decorate the Test Method with testMethod attribute


AAA pattern:

Arrange: initializes objects and sets the value of the data that is passed to the method being tested
Act: invokes the method being tested
Asset: verifies that the method being tested behaves as expected


Benefits:
- find bugs early
- reduce production bugs
- make complex code easy to understand
- provide documentation
- save development time
- Easier to change and refactor* code
- Developers become more confident

*Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software.


Operations in VS:

1) Create a blank Solution
2) add a new project hosting the Calculator class and Divide method
3) add a new Test project hosting the AAA pattern
4) run the test
